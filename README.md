# Rainbow-Table-Attack

I choose to do this project for my cs class "Network and computer security".
The project is the implementation of the famous rainbow attack method.
Currently it is designed to generate rainbow tables for md5 4 digits numerical passwords and obviously
crack md5 hashes that are generated from 4 digits numerical input.

It can crack a single md5 hash given from the command line or it can crack multiple md5 hashes given from a text file with the name crackMe.txt

If i have enough time i will implement sha256 hash cracking, increase digits it can crack, add characters, polish the code and include much needed exception handling.

If anybody is reading this any feedback is deeply appreciated.
Cheers!
